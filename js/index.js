// Create a JavaScript function that permits the creation of a hamburger object

    assortments of cheeses, 
    specialty sauces, 
    different meat patties(beef, chicken, vegetarian), 
    single, double, or triple patty, 
    Pickles, hot peppers, olives etc.

// Make sure that the function allows for the output of a sentence that describes the hamburger, too
